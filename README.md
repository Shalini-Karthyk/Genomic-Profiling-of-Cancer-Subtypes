# Genomic Profiling of Cancer Subtypes: Statistical & Biological Insights

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of cancer subtypes using various statistical and clustering techniques to gain insights into disease markers and gene expression patterns. The analysis was conducted from October 2022 to December 2022 in association with Northeastern University.

### Objectives
- Identify significant genes in B-cell ALL patient cohorts.
- Analyze gene expression datasets to reveal distinct cancer subtypes.
- Confirm relationships between oncogenes to ensure robustness and reliability in genomic research.

### Key Steps and Techniques
1. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Conducted ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) and Kruskal-Wallis tests to identify significant genes in B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) patient cohorts.

2. **Clustering Analysis:**
   - Applied hierarchical clustering and k-means algorithms to analyze gene expression datasets, specifically Golub and NCI60 datasets, revealing distinct cancer subtypes.

3. **Correlation and Validation:**
   - Utilized correlation analysis to examine relationships between oncogenes.
   - Applied bootstrap validation to confirm these relationships, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the genomic research.

### Technologies and Tools Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python, R
- **Libraries and Tools:** NumPy, SciPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Statistical Methods:** ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test, correlation analysis, bootstrap validation
- **Clustering Algorithms:** Hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering

## Conclusion
The project successfully identified significant genes and distinct cancer subtypes through rigorous statistical analysis and clustering techniques. The correlation and validation steps ensured the reliability of the findings, contributing valuable insights into genomic profiling of cancer subtypes.
